# Convention-Agent

The Convention Agent plugin is made to keep order in you Unreal Engine project. It will tell users whenever an asset is not named according to naming-standard your team has set up. The plugin comes with a predefined config for naming, but can be fully changed to adjust to your standards!

Convention Agent is inspired by [Linter](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/linter), which has been discontinued.
